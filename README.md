# node-red-contrib-grove-edison
(unofficial) Node-RED nodes that interact with Grove sensors on the Intel Edison Board

# Setup
Copy these nodes into the <node-red>/nodes directory. Nodes rely on the following modules:
* jsupm_grove
* jsupm_i2clcd
* mraa

# Caution
These are nodes I built quickly and haven't extensively tested. They may break. Feedback welcomed!
